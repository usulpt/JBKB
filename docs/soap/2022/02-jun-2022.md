## technical comm, truth

- putting the complete URL for the images used in the presentation (don't remember seeing it before)
- good crowd interaction comes from general questions, quietly put, non-confrontational
- if people get interrupted while reading our stuff, can they go back easily?
- the target audience needs **entry/exit points** to the knowledge
- don't write how the task can be done, write how the user will perform the task

## a robot didn't write this

* AI - think like humans
* ML - machine learns things without explicit programming
* DL - improved learning process building neural networks

#### 4 pillars for AI

1. Be transparent
2. Set expectations
	1. Explain what it can do and its limitations
3. Explain results
	1. Show supporting data points and disclose how the algorithm works
4. Show confidence

## training as code

presenter maintains technical training at akamai university
check akamai github repos: https://github.com/ynohat/mdtk

#### markdown trainkit

* content repository
* markdown toolkit (common md syntax, md fragments, variable interpolation, doc structure, syntax highlighting)
* infrastructure tooling

advantages:
* customization
	* variable interpolation with different templates for customers/partners/devs
* consistency
	* uniform look and feel across large environment (**PUSH THIS HARD**)
* scalability
	* templates can be applied to as many resources as necessary (**PUSH THIS HARD**)
* version control
	* track content changes over time (**PUSH THIS HARD**)
* auditability and cooperation
	* content resources reviewed easily
* reusability
	* include pieces of training in many parts of training or in other documentation sections, linked to training materials (**PUSH THIS HARD**)

*narrating markdown material*
*web videos and markdown integration with web based courses*

## content operations
optimize the delivery but focus on optimizing upstream, where content is produced
*gathercontent (link)*

* set of principles used to optimise content production to leverage conent as business assets

content is one of the oldest disciplines yet has the least mature operational controls

improvements
* keep central repository with good taxonomy (**NOT**)
* robust workflow, version control (**GOT**)
* easy to reuse content from a single source (**NOT**)
* authoring system tracks content reuse from a dashboard (**NOT**)
* automated tagging (**NOT**)
* integrated style guide (**NOT**)
* cost effective localisation (**GOT**)

*contentseriously (link)*

## place for documentation in a modern product
guy starts out with a disclaimer stating that his views do not match with his employers'

great product = f (great e2e ux)

built on:
* concept
	* idea
	* vision
	* strategy
* solution
	* design
	* technology
	* implementation
	* quality
* delivery
	* deployment
	* introduction
	* learning/training
* satisfaction
	* use
	* support
	* maintenance

future:
* smart content, adopting context of how the Product is used
* multi-lingual
* AI-assisted, with content created for the AI, not by the AI
* multi-channel (text, UI embedded, voice, video, simulated)
* legal, compliance: always in paper
* users will continue losing reading skills

how to work with product
* collaborate
	* **show value via metrics**
	* **join the regular demo**
	* add yourself to the team
* insist on
	* extending vision and strategy
	* **being part of ux**
	* adding content as attribute of personas
	* extending backlog
	* extending epics entry/exit criteria
* educate on
	* process
	* technologies
	* user experience

## creator economy
no notes, interesting experiences from both speakers on the rise of creator economy and the production of content for any medium from low experience. cute, but not useful.

## productivity working from home
no notes, thoroughly data-driven using an internal company multi-country survey on pandemic working habits and experiences. derivative and not useful, very scared and nervous speaker

## take a step back and stay the same
before:
* a technical writer is someone who can understand complicated processes and explain them in clear, easy-to-understand prose
now:
* basic skills:
	* knowledge of technology
	* writing ability
		* literature knowledge doesn't make for a good tech writer
	* organisational skills
	* detective and people skills
		* manage missing, incoherent information
	* analysis and problem solving skills
	* understanding user needs
	* indexing
		* with references to where they appear (**Maybe we need something like this**)
	* variables
		* reusing content

DAR for daily tasks with extra metadata and actions:

|task|skill|fun|transfer|improve|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|what you need to do|what skill will you use|will it be fun|can you transfer it to another task|does your skill need improving to do this task|

*figma (look it up)*
*docs as code (read it)*
*sme (look it up)*

## power, simplicity and the content conundrum
power: ability of a theory to explain the data
simplicity: fewer axioms and entities

power and simplicity are in conflict
as power increases, simplicity decreases and vice versa

online speaker, very much off-topic for the most part of the talk, wandered through philosophical considerations and high-level technical rhetoric
